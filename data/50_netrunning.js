Hacking is not a separate mini-game. It occurs in real-time, on the same initiative count as physical combat.

## 6.1 The Wireless World
Netrunners view the world through an AR Overlay. Physical objects often have digital shadows.
* **Guards** have **Biomonitors**.
* **Turrets** have **Targeting IFFs**.
* **Doors** have **Smart Locks**.

## 6.2 Resolution
Hacking is an Action Check using **SHARP (Diamond)** + **Interface Skill**.
* **Defense:** Digital objects have a **Firewall Rating** (Target Difficulty).
* **Damage:** Hacking does not deal "HP Damage." It applies **Status Effects**.

## 6.3 Quickhacks (Status Effects)
* **GLITCH:** The target is momentarily hindered. -2 Score to their next Action or Defense.
* **LOOP:** The target repeats their last action (e.g., walking into a wall) or freezes.
* **BRICK:** The target hardware ceases to function until rebooted (requiring a technician).
* **SPOOF:** The target perceives a false input (e.g., hearing footsteps, seeing a grenade indicator) and reacts accordingly.`;
