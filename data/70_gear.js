Weapons do not add flat bonuses. Instead, they provide **Tags** that allow you to manipulate the outcome of a hand.

## 8.1 Weapon Tags
* **Pistol (Quickdraw):** You may draw **1 Card** immediately when rolling Initiative.
* **Shotgun (Spread):** On a successful hit, you may discard 1 card to deal the same damage to an adjacent target.
* **Sniper Rifle (Reach):** Ignores range penalties. If you take an Aim action, you may treat the Flop as having a Wild Card.
* **Assault Rifle (Auto):** *Suppression.* On a hit, the target's **Skill Rank** is reduced by 1 for their next turn.
* **Monowire (Sever):** On a Critical Success (Trips or better), you disable a piece of the target's Cyberware or Armor permanently.

## 8.2 Defensive Gear
* **Light Armor:** Ignore damage from hands ranking "High Card".
* **Heavy Armor:** Ignore damage from hands ranking "Pair" or lower. Reduces **Maneuver** Skill by 1.`;
