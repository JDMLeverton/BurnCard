Characters are limited by their biology. There is no Cyberpsychosis mechanic; there is only **Bandwidth**.

## 5.1 The Integration Limit
A character has a number of **Integration Slots** equal to their **SOUL Attribute Rank + 1**.
* *Example:* A character with SOUL 2 has 3 Slots.

## 5.2 Slot Cost
* **Passive Ware (0 Slots):** Cosmetic changes, basic prosthetics (standard arm replacement), reinforced bones. These do not require active neural handshakes.
* **Active Ware (1-3 Slots):** Items that modify the Card Economy or require active thought to use.

## 5.3 Catalogue Examples
* **Reflex Booster (2 Slots):** *Active.* Increase Refresh Rate by +1 (Draw 2 cards per turn instead of 1).
* **Subdermal Plating (1 Slot):** *Active.* Treat "High Card" as "Pair" when Defending.
* **Smart Link (1 Slot):** *Active.* If you score a Flush using Diamonds, treat it as +2 Points.
* **Cybereyes (0 Slots):** *Passive.* Standard HUD and recording. (Upgrades like Thermoptics cost 1 Slot).`;
