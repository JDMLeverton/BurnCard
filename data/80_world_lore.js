> "The future isn't evenly distributed. It's partitioned, geofenced, and paywalled."

## 8.1 Overview: The Glass Cage
The year is 2075. The apocalyptic collapse predicted by the 20th century never happened. No nuclear fire, no alien invasion. Instead, the world succumbed to **The Great Consolidation**—a slow, bureaucratic suffocation of the old world in the name of efficiency and safety.

Society is defined by the **Glass Cage**: a state of total, passive surveillance where safety is guaranteed, provided you remain within the parameters of your socioeconomic tier.

## 8.2 History: The Reformation (2035–2055)
The transition to the Friction Era was driven by two failures: The War and The Dollar.

### The Lithium Campaigns (2038-2044)
Desperate to secure battery resources for the automation revolution, the US launched a "Stabilization Intervention" in South America. It was a quagmire. The land war drained the treasury, radicalized a generation of veterans, and accelerated the collapse of the domestic economy. 
* *Legacy:* Much of the "Military Surplus" cyberware on the streets today dates back to the Andean theatre.

### The Fiscal Reformation (2048)
Following the war, hyperinflation threatened to turn the US Dollar into confetti. In 2048, the Federal Reserve initiated **The Reset**. 
* **The New Dollar ($):** The currency was redenominated. Old accounts were frozen and converted at a brutal exchange rate.
* **The Audit:** The Reset was used to identify and seize assets from "Non-Compliant" citizens, effectively wiping out the savings of the lower class overnight.

### The Migration (2050s)
With the economy reset, the government realized it could no longer afford to subsidize the rural interior. They initiated "Service Sunsets," cutting power and water to rural towns, forcing the population into dense **Metro-Hubs**.

## 8.3 Geopolitics: The Hollow State
The United States still exists, but it has transitioned from a Sovereign Nation to a **Platform Manager**. Washington D.C. manages **The Ledger** (Currency) and **The Shield** (Defense), but has ceded almost all domestic responsibility to Charter Corporations and Local Municipalities.

**🟢 The Green Zones (Charter Cities)**
Wealthy metroplexes (Cascadia, NorCal, Neo-Austin).
* **Governance:** Corporate feudalism. You subscribe to citizenship.
* **Enforcement:** Private security (Securitas, Militech). Response times are under 30 seconds.

**🔴 The Red Zones (Federal Territories)**
The abandoned rural expanse and rust-belt ruins.
* **Governance:** The Absentee Landlord. The Feds claim ownership but provide no services.
* **Enforcement:** Local Sheriffs, "Community Defense" militias, or gangs. The Feds only intervene to protect tax-generating assets (Automated Farms).

**🟡 The Grey (The Friction)**
Logistics hubs, transit lines, and the spaces between zones. This is where the **Burn Cards** operate.

## 8.4 The Economy: The Trap

### Digital Supremacy
95% of transactions are digital. They are instant, convenient, and permanently logged on the Federal Ledger. Buying a coffee creates a data point. Buying a train ticket creates a data point.

### Physical Cash (The "Hard" Dollar)
Physical money still exists, ostensibly for "emergency resilience," but it is a trap for the unwary.
* **The Bills:** Polymer-woven notes ($1, $5, $10, $20, $100). Each bill has a unique RFID strip and Barcode.
* **The Quarter:** The only remaining coin. It contains a passive serial chip.
* **The Trace:** Cash isn't anonymous; it's just **high-latency**. When you withdraw cash, the serials are linked to your ID. When you spend it at a vending machine or a shop, the serial is scanned and re-logged. The System eventually knows where the money went; it just takes 24 hours to process the batch.

### Black Scrip
The only true privacy is **Scrip**—decentralized, illegal block-chain tokens used by the underworld. You need Scrip to buy things the System doesn't want you to have: unregistered guns, real meat, and freedom.

## 8.5 The Myth of Invisibility
Privacy is treated as a system error.
* **The Data Void:** Systems look for patterns. A citizen with no digital footprint is a statistical anomaly, triggering immediate "Containment Protocols."
* **Tradecraft:** You cannot hide from the system; you must lie to it. High-level operators do not block their signals; they broadcast a perfect, boring lie.
* **Identity Partitioning:** The core skill of the underworld is separating your "Real ID" (the boring citizen who pays taxes) from your "Burn Cards" (disposable personas used for illicit work).`;
