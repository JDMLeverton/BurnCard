In the Friction Era, corporations are not just companies; they are **Infrastructure**. They manage the air, the water, the roads, and the thoughts of the population. While hundreds of companies exist, six giants (The "Hex") form the load-bearing pillars of the economy.

## 1. AXIOM (The Mind)
**Sector:** Data, AI, Search, Reality Augmentation.
* **The Pitch:** "The World's Operating System."
* **The Reality:** A patronizing, omnipresent surveillance state disguised as a helpful assistant. Their "Axiom Lens" AR glasses overlay reality for 80% of the population.
* **The Threat:** If Axiom bans you, you become a "Digital Ghost." You lose access to banking, maps, and communication.
* **Vibe:** Clean, white minimalist campuses. Security guards in polo shirts who smile while they detain you.

## 2. PRIME LOGISTICS (The Blood)
**Sector:** Logistics, Manufacturing, Infrastructure.
* **The Pitch:** "From our Fab-Center to your door in 40 minutes."
* **The Reality:** The utilitarian backbone of the Hollow State. They run the autonomous trains, the water pipelines, and the delivery drone swarms that darken the skies of the Red Zones.
* **The Threat:** They control the flow of atoms. If Prime blacklists a neighborhood, that neighborhood starves.
* **Vibe:** Brutalist concrete, endless warehouses, exhausted humans in exoskeletons working alongside robots.

## 3. HELIX DYNAMICS (The Future)
**Sector:** Innovation, Cybernetics, Aerospace.
* **The Pitch:** "Evolution is a choice."
* **The Reality:** Volatile, dangerous, and exciting. Run by an unstable Board (possibly guided by an AI ghost of the founder), Helix pushes tech too far, too fast. They make the best Cyberware and the fastest orbital shuttles.
* **The Threat:** Their tech is experimental. It fails. It explodes. But it's the only way to get an edge.
* **Vibe:** Chrome, neon, erratic. Mad science labs and sleek showrooms.

## 4. PULSE (The Soul)
**Sector:** Media, Social Credit, Gig Economy.
* **The Pitch:** "Connect. Share. Be."
* **The Reality:** The opiate of the masses. In a world of mass unemployment, Pulse keeps the population sedated with VR, gamified "Gig" work, and social validation.
* **The Threat:** They weaponize reputation. They can spin a narrative that turns a saint into a terrorist in 15 minutes.
* **Vibe:** Colorful, loud, addictive, shallow.

## 5. VERDANT SYSTEMS (The Body)
**Sector:** Agriculture, Bio-Tech, Pharma.
* **The Pitch:** "Feeding the Future."
* **The Reality:** They own the biology. They patented the gene-seeds that survive the climate collapse. They grow the "Vat-Meat" and nutrient paste that makes up The Ration.
* **The Threat:** Biological warfare disguised as pest control. Crop protection drones that shoot to kill.
* **Vibe:** Bio-Industrial. Green logos, images of happy families, backed by ruthless IP lawyers.

## 6. KINETIC SOLUTIONS (The Force)
**Sector:** Defense, Private Security, Heavy Industry.
* **The Pitch:** "Peace through Strength."
* **The Reality:** The boring, terrifying face of state violence. They are the primary contractor for the US "Shield." They don't make consumer gadgets; they make orbital kill-sats, riot tanks, and border walls.
* **The Threat:** Overwhelming, disciplined kinetic force. They are the hammer.
* **Vibe:** Gunmetal grey, secure facilities, acronyms, silence.`;
