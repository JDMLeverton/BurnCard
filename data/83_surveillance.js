"You think turning off your comms makes you safe? It just makes you a black hole. And the System *hates* empty space."

## The Negative Space Problem
In 2075, privacy is treated as a system error.
* **The Heartbeat:** The City Grid expects a constant stream of data from every citizen (Biometrics, Location, Ad-Preferences). 
* **The Void:** If you go "Dark," you create a data void. Algorithms are programmed to hunt voids. A person with no signal is statistically likely to be a terrorist, a smuggler, or a corpse. All three warrant a drone response.

## Tradecraft: Signal Noise
The key to survival isn't **hiding**; it is **blending**.
* **The Gray Man:** To avoid detection, you must look exactly like the data the system expects to see. You don't wear a mask; you wear a face that the algorithm ignores.
* **Data Camouflage:** A good Runner doesn't block the camera; they spoof the feed to show a bored salaryman waiting for a bus.

## The Burn Card Doctrine
This is the core methodology of the underworld.
* **Identity Partitioning:** Never commit a crime with your Real ID (The one tied to your Ration).
* **The Burn Card:** A disposable, synthetic persona. It has a fake name, a fake credit history, and a fake biometric signature.
    * *Usage:* You slot a Burn Card to cross a checkpoint or buy a gun. The system sees "John Doe, Plumber, Credit Score 600." It lets you pass.
    * *Disposal:* Once the job is done, you "Burn" the card—wiping the encryption keys. The persona ceases to exist. The crime is tied to a ghost.`;
