## The Graying State
In 2075, the United States is smaller, older, and colder.
* **Population:** ~285 Million (Down from peak of 340M).
* **The Inversion:** The birth rate has collapsed. The average citizen is 55 years old. Life-extension tech keeps the elderly alive, creating a top-heavy society where the young are a rare, burdened minority.

## The Density Paradox
Despite the population drop, the Charter Cities feel more crowded than ever.
* **Consolidation:** To cut infrastructure costs, the population was funneled into ten mega-regions.
* **The Empty Map:** Outside the Green Zones and the Containment Sprawls, America is empty. Ghost towns, automated Ag-Combines, and silent highways stretch for thousands of miles.

## The Role of the Surplus
With automation handling 90% of labor, humanity has faced an existential crisis: *What are we for?*

### 1. Entropy Mining (Attention Labor)
The AI systems that run the world suffer from "Model Collapse" if fed only their own data. They need the chaos of human input.
* **The Job:** The unemployed masses earn their Ration bonuses by consuming content. Watching ads, playing AR games, voting on algorithmic polls.
* **The Reality:** You aren't the consumer; you are the training data.

### 2. Bio-Service (The Luxury of Flesh)
For the wealthy, human labor is a Veblen Good—desirable *because* it is expensive and inefficient.
* **Status:** An AI can pour a perfect drink. But having a human bartender who gets the order wrong? That shows you have money to waste.
* **The Gig:** Many "Burn Cards" start here—working service jobs in Green Zones, invisible to the elites they serve, gathering intel.

## Immigration: Fortress America
In a post-labor economy, immigrants are viewed as "Unfunded Liabilities."
* **The Wall:** The borders are enforced by automated drone swarms. There is no asylum. There is no entry without a Corporate Sponsor.
* **The Golden Ticket:** The only legal path to citizenship is **Exceptionalism**. If you have a Genius-level IQ, a rare genetic sequence, or Olympic-level athleticism, the Corps will bid on you. Everyone else is kept out.`;
