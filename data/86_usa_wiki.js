The **United States of America** in 2075 is a contradiction: it is both the most technologically advanced nation on Earth and a crumbling, feudal relic. Following the **Great Consolidation** of the mid-21st century, the nation transitioned from a monolithic superpower into a **"Hollow State"**—a federal platform that manages currency and defense, while ceding day-to-day governance to Corporate Charters and automated bureaucracies.

## History: The Reformation
The America of the 20th century died not with a bang, but with a budget cut.

### The Resource Crisis (2035–2045)
By 2035, the combination of climate destabilization and the automation of 60% of the labor force created a fiscal death spiral. The tax base collapsed. Rural infrastructure became prohibitively expensive to maintain against constant flooding, fires, and super-storms.

### The Great Consolidation (2050s)
Facing bankruptcy, the Federal Government enacted the **Urban Consolidation Acts**. The logic was actuarial: it cost less to house a million people in a dense, fortified Metro-Hub than to maintain roads and power for them spread across a state.
* **Service Sunsets:** Subsidies for rural power and water were cut.
* **The Migration:** Within a decade, 80% of the population retreated into 10 massive urban agglomerations.

## Government & Politics
The US Government functions less like a sovereign state and more like a Holding Company.

### The Platform State
Washington D.C. creates the "Operating System" for society, but does not run the apps.
* **Federal Responsibilities:** The Ledger (Currency), Orbital Defense, Interstate Commerce.
* **Local Responsibilities:** Policing, Healthcare, Education, Infrastructure. These are largely privatized or run by local Warlords in the Red Zones.

### Gov-OS
The bureaucracy is administered by **Gov-OS**, a massive AI architecture implemented in 2048. It is efficient, incorruptible, and utterly devoid of empathy. Citizens do not argue with the government; they submit ticket requests to an algorithm that may not be processed for years.

## Society & Demographics
The population has stabilized at ~285 million, creating an "Inverted Pyramid" demographic.

### The Graying State
Children are an economic liability in a post-labor world. The birth rate has collapsed. The average American is 55 years old, kept alive by cheap life-extension gene therapies. The youth are a rare, burdened minority supporting a massive geriatric class.

### Social Stratification
* **Citizens (Green Zones):** Corporate employees and the wealthy. They live in gated "Charter Cities" with private police, real food, and human services.
* **Residents (The Sprawl):** The unemployed majority. They survive on **The Ration** (UBI) and live in high-density housing blocks. They are pacified by cheap entertainment and automated healthcare.
* **The Remnants (Red Zones):** Those who refused to move. They live in the abandoned rural expanse, legally cut off from the grid, surviving on salvage and black-market agriculture.

## Economy: The Trap
The economy is bifurcated into two distinct loops: **The Ledger** and **The Scrip**.

### The Ration
Every citizen receives a monthly deposit of **Ledger Credits**. This digital currency is "Smart Money"—it is geo-locked and restricted. You can buy nutrient paste, pay rent in a Gov-Block, or buy a bus ticket. You *cannot* buy alcohol, firearms, or unauthorized travel.

### The Reformation Dollar
The "Real" economy runs on the **New Dollar ($)**. Physical cash exists but is heavily tracked via RFID strips. To buy illicit goods or human services (Artisanal Humanity), one must use **Black Scrip**—illegal decentralized tokens.

## Freedom of Movement
While technically free to travel, the American population is tethered by **Weaponized Bureaucracy**.

### The Residency Trap
State funding is tied to census numbers. To keep their tax base, States make it administratively impossible to leave.
* **The Waitlist:** Transferring your Ration Residency from one state to another takes 18-36 months of processing.
* **The Tether:** If you move without approval, your Ration cuts off after 72 hours. This keeps the poor locked in their designated zones, not by walls, but by the threat of starvation.

## Geography: The Hubs
The population is concentrated in ten mega-regions.

### The Eastern Corridor (BosWash)
The dying political heart. NYC and DC are walled fortresses holding back the rising Atlantic. The region is a vertical hierarchy: the rich live in the Spires, breathing filtered air; the poor live in the shadows of the sea-walls.

### The North Coast (The Water Baronies)
Buffalo, Rochester, and Detroit have become strategic fortresses. Controlling the Great Lakes—the world's largest freshwater reserve—they are the "Saudi Arabia of Water." The region is militarized, industrial, and fiercely protective of its pipelines.

### The Expanse
The space between cities. Endless automated monoculture farms run by combines, patrolled by hunter-killer drones. It is a lonely, dangerous place where only the Remnants and the **Burn Cards** dare to travel.`;
