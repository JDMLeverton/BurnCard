## 0.1 Design Philosophy
**Burn Card** is a Cyberpunk tabletop RPG built on a simple premise: **Resource Management = Dramatic Tension.** We reject the simulation of physics (calculating blast radiuses) in favor of the emulation of fiction (calculating consequences). The mechanics are designed to push players toward high-risk, high-reward behavior typical of the genre.

## 0.2 The Aesthetic
The game utilizes a standard 54-card deck and poker chips. These are not just random number generators; they are physical representations of a character's luck, stamina, and agency. When a player holds a physical hand of cards, they hold their fate.`;
