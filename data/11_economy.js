## 2.1 The Hand
Your hand represents your current capacity to act, dodge, and exert effort.
* **Max Hand Size:** Default **5**. (Modified by Cyberware).
* **Empty Hand:** If you have 0 cards, you are **Vulnerable**. You cannot perform complex actions, and you cannot Defend.

## 2.2 Refresh Phase
You do **not** automatically draw back to full after every action.
* **Trigger:** At the start of your turn.
* **Effect:** Draw **1 Card**.
* *Note:* This creates an economy of scarcity. Burning 3 cards for a massive attack leaves you with fewer options for Defense.

## 2.3 Defense (The Dodge Drain)
Neon Deck uses "Active Defense." There is no passive Armor Class.
1.  **The Attack:** The GM presents a **Threat Value** (e.g., "The Corp Solo fires at you. Threat 4").
2.  **The Response:** To avoid the hit, you must play cards + Attribute to beat the Threat.
3.  **The Consequence:** If you fail or choose to fold, you take **Damage**.

## 2.4 Edge (Chips)
Spend Chips to break the rules:
* **The Kicker (1 Chip):** Add **+1** to your Final Score.
* **The Gambit (1 Chip):** Swap a held card with the face-down **Burn Card**.
* **The Ante (3 Chips):** Increase your **Skill Rank** by +1 for this action (adding another card to your pool).`;
