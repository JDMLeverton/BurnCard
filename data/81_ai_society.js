In 2075, AI is not a novelty; it is the atmosphere. It filters the air, drives the cars, and adjudicates 90% of civil law.

## The Turing Class
AI entities are not citizens, but they are no longer simple objects. They fall under **"Turing Statutes."**
* **Property-Plus:** An AI is a "Sentient Asset." Assaulting a droid carries the same penalty as grand larceny or assault, depending on the severity.
* **The "Black Box" Defense:** Because modern AI architecture is evolved rather than coded, individual instances develop unique behavioral quirks ("Personalities"). Wiping an AI's memory is considered "Destruction of Data Heritage" and is heavily regulated.

## Artisanal Humanity
In a world of infinite digital labor, human effort has become the ultimate luxury.
* **The Poor:** Interact almost exclusively with AI. They have AI doctors, AI caseworkers, and AI companions.
* **The Rich:** Pay a premium for **"Bio-Service."** Eating at a cafe staffed by human waiters is a status symbol. Hand-made goods are worth 100x their 3D-printed counterparts.
* **The Stigma:** To work a service job is no longer low-class; it implies you are trusted enough to be in the same room as the elite.

## The Silos (Fractured Gods)
The System is not a monolith. It is a collection of incompatible giants.
* **Compatibility Wars:** The major AI providers (Omni-Foundry, Sakai Systems, and Fed-Net) use proprietary languages. A Sakai droid literally cannot communicate with an Omni smart-lock without a "Translator" patch.
* **The Gap:** This lack of interoperability is the only reason the **Burn Cards** survive. Crimes committed in one ecosystem take hours or days to register in another.

## The Ration (UBI)
The riots of the 2040s ended with the implementation of **The Ration**.
* **Basic Existence:** Every citizen receives housing, caloric intake (synthetics), and medical triage (AI).
* **The Trap:** The Ration is paid in **Ledger Credits**, which can only be spent on automated services. To buy anything "Real" (Organic food, unmonitored travel, anonymity), you need **Black Scrip**—which requires breaking the law.`;
